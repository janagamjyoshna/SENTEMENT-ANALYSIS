------------DESCRIPTION------------------



Developed a Sentiment Analysis application using Python in IDLE, aimed at classifying the sentiment of user-generated text (e.g., product reviews, tweets, or feedback) as positive, negative, or neutral. The project involved collecting and preprocessing a dataset consisting of labeled text samples sourced from [e.g., Kaggle, NLTK corpora, or scraped social media data].

Text preprocessing steps included tokenization, stopword removal, lowercasing, lemmatization/stemming, and handling of punctuation using libraries such as NLTK and re (regex). The cleaned text data was then converted into numerical format using techniques like TF-IDF Vectorization or CountVectorizer from scikit-learn.

Implemented and trained multiple machine learning models, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), and evaluated their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. Performed model tuning and cross-validation to improve generalization.

The final model achieved an accuracy of [X%] on unseen data and demonstrated strong classification capabilities. Built a simple interactive interface using Pythonâ€™s built-in input/output methods within IDLE, allowing users to enter custom text and receive real-time sentiment predictions.

This project strengthened my skills in natural language processing (NLP), text classification, and the use of Python libraries such as NLTK, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for both analysis and visualization. It also demonstrated the ability to build end-to-end ML workflows using lightweight development environments like IDLE.

ðŸ”§ Optional Add-ons (include if applicable)
Let me know if you also:

Used Pandas/NumPy for data manipulation

Visualized sentiment distribution using matplotlib or seaborn

Performed word cloud analysis or n-gram frequency analysis

Created a script or .py file for reuse

Plan to deploy or expand it into a GUI or web app
